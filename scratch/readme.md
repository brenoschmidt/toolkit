# `scratch` module

A sandbox for experimentation, testing, and quick prototyping.

## Purpose

The `scratch` module acts as a personal "scratch pad" for temporary or
throwaway Python code. Itâ€™s a safe, isolated space to:

- Test snippets and small functions
- Prototype ideas before moving them into production code
- Debug behaviors and library usage
- Experiment without polluting core modules
